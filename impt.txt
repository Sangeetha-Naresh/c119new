after import nltk
do this only omce : nltk.download('punkt')

You only need to execute nltk.download('punkt') once to download the 'punkt' tokenizer resource. 
After downloading it, NLTK will store the resource locally on your system, so you won't need to download it again 
unless you reinstall NLTK or manually remove the downloaded files. 
Therefore, you don't have to execute this each time you run your code unless the 'punkt' resource gets removed 
or corrupted
